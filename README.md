# Programming1-Practicals-InHaxe

Practical exercises done during the Programming 1 module.

These practical exercises were originally made in Java, I'm translating them in Haxe as part of my self study aimed towards learning Haxe.

Each folder may contain a file named Take Aways.md where I note what I think is the most important stuff I learnt thanks to that exercise.
