# Take Away points from this practical

## Arithmetic exceptions

Haxe doesn't throw an arithmetic exception when dividing a number by 0.
It instead requires the result to be in a float variable and outputs "Infinity" as the result.

## Missing tasks

Task2 is about dividing a float by 0, the result is the same as Task1.
Task3 is about dividing floats by floats, I don't think I can learn much from that so not doing it for now, might add it later.
